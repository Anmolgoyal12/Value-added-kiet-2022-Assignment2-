                <p style="font-size:14px;">I belong to ghazibad and it is famous for temples,mall,habitat center.Ghaziabad is a city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and a part of Delhi NCR. It is the administrative headquarters of Ghaziabad district and is the largest city
                    in western Uttar Pradesh, Subsequently, the Mohan Meakin breweries were also set up in the year 1949. This period also saw the development of Ghaziabad as one of India's most famous centres of the Oil Engines industry.Ghaziabad city
                    is governed by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation under the Uttar Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1959. Ghaziabad city is spread over 210 km2 (81 sq mi) of municipal area. It upgraded from a Municipal Board to a Municipal Corporation
                    on 31 August 1994, following the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act. Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (or Nagar Nigam Ghaziabad) is divided into 5 zones - City Zone, Kavi Nagar Zone, Vijay Nagar Zone, Mohan Nagar Zone and Vasundhara
                    Zone. The Municipal Corporation comprises 100 wards, with councillors elected from each ward. The local elections to all wards was last held in 2017. The executive head is Mahendra Singh Tanwar, the current Municipal Commissioner[citation
                    needed] while the elected head is the Mayor, Asha Sharma from the BJP. In 2022, Assembly Election Atul Garg, Bhartiya Janta Party candidate won the election.Is Ghaziabad a good place to live? It is a popular city to live in because
                    of its proximity to Delhi. Even many who work in Delhi and Noida, make Ghaziabad their home. Good public transport, recreational facilities, availability of schools and medical facilities all make Ghaziabad popular among residents.The
                    street food here is mix of traditional and contemporary favourites. Many of the traditional shops are as old as over sixty-five years or more and they gave us a semblance of Old Delhi. Inspite of the heavy influx of modern and international
                    influences, majority of the population still loves to gorge on the zesty traditional street food fares like Chaats, Moonglet, Dahi bhalle etc. There are truly some good eateries whose foods and stories will make you fall in love with
                    them. After visiting the city on three different occasions, we have come up with a basic list of the the go-to places that you can explore. The food scene is so diverse and widespread that we need multiple visits to actually come up
                    with a comprehensive list of the same.
